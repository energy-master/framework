Building data adapters


1. Add the exit routine to prevent op running
2. Add snapshot ids - user merge routine 
3. Set location to correct value 

4. ddownload data first into local folder 
5. change to load data and build derived data objects 

note:   need to see what is available and load and downlaod the rest to speed up development
        at the moment all available or not
        is the optimisation routine only built for one ss?
        Need to scale up to multiple ss 


        marlin_bot_run -> one ss will suffice
        ident_run -> optimisation engine so need more ss scalability



Running:

1. set sim ids for running against


2.
